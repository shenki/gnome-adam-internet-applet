Installation Instructions
-------------------------

Firstly, make sure you have the following installed:
 - Python (>= 2.3)
 - GNOME 2
 - PyGTK 
 - Any additional gnome-python-extras or python-gnome-extras
   packages for your system.


Extract the archive and run the following as root:

# python setup.py install

You should now be able to right-click on your GNOME panel, choose
'Add to Panel' and select the Internode Usage Meter Applet.

If the applet does not appear in the list, try running the following:
 # bonobo-slay
 # killall gnome-panel


Good luck and enjoy!
